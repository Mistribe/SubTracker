## Recommended Actions

### High Priority (Add New Tests)

1. **Family Management** (`tests/e2e/family/`)
   - ✅ Keep: `family/creation.spec.ts` - Implement create family test
   - ✅ Keep: `family/invitations.spec.ts` - Implement invite/accept tests
   - ➕ Add: `family/management.spec.ts` - View members, remove member, leave family

2. **Profile & Preferences** (`tests/e2e/profile/`)
   - ✅ Keep: `profile/settings.spec.ts` - Implement profile settings tests
   - ✅ Keep: `profile/preferences.spec.ts` - Implement preferences tests

### Medium Priority (Verify Existing)

3. **Dashboard Navigation** (`tests/e2e/dashboard/`)
   - ✅ Keep: `dashboard/navigation.spec.ts` - Verify it tests sidebar/menu navigation properly

### Low Priority (Keep as-is)

4. **Core Features** - All subscription, provider, label, and auth tests are complete and comprehensive

---

## Tests to Remove

❌ **None** - All existing test files should be kept as they cover principal features

---

## Test Files Status

### ✅ Keep & Complete (No changes needed)
- `tests/e2e/auth/happy-path.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/subscriptions/happy-path.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/providers/happy-path.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/labels/happy-path.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/dashboard/summary.spec.ts`

### ⚠️ Keep & Verify
- `tests/e2e/dashboard/navigation.spec.ts` - Check if properly implemented

### ⚠️ Keep & Implement
- `tests/e2e/family/creation.spec.ts` - Currently stub, needs implementation
- `tests/e2e/family/invitations.spec.ts` - Currently stub, needs implementation
- `tests/e2e/profile/settings.spec.ts` - Currently stub, needs implementation
- `tests/e2e/profile/preferences.spec.ts` - Currently stub, needs implementation

### ➕ Add New
- `tests/e2e/family/management.spec.ts` - For viewing/managing family members

---

## Notes

- **Testing Philosophy**: All tests follow "Happy Path Only" approach - testing successful workflows without error scenarios
- **Test Organization**: Tests use Page Object Model pattern with helper utilities for maintainability
- **Cleanup**: All tests properly clean up test data in afterEach hooks
- **API Integration**: Tests use API helpers to create test data reliably, then test UI interactions

---

## Execution Time Considerations

Current test suite is well-balanced:
- **Core CRUD operations** are covered efficiently with lifecycle tests
- **Navigation tests** verify key user journeys without redundancy
- **Data validation** tests ensure accuracy without excessive verification

To keep test runs short:
1. Avoid testing every field validation - focus on happy paths
2. Use API helpers for setup/teardown (faster than UI)
3. Run family/profile tests only after implementation
4. Consider parallel execution for independent test suites
