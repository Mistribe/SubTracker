## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud (Hosted) ‚Äî Coming Soon
The hosted SubTracker Cloud is in the works. Sign up to get notified when the beta launches. Until then, you can self-host with Docker or run locally from source.

---

## üöÄ Quickstart

1) Clone and install

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd SubTracker/web
npm install
```

2) Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in `web/` with the following keys:

```
# Backend API
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Auth (Kinde)
VITE_KINDE_CLIENT_ID=your_kinde_client_id
VITE_KINDE_DOMAIN=your_kinde_domain
VITE_KINDE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_KINDE_LOGOUT_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_KINDE_AUDIENCE=your_kinde_audience

# Optional
VITE_TARGET_ENV=development
```

3) Start the app

```
npm run dev
```

4) Build & preview production

```
npm run build
npm run preview
```

> Note: The backend is a Go (Golang) service. Make sure it‚Äôs running and that `VITE_BACKEND_URL` points to it.

## üè† Self-hosted (Docker Compose)
Prerequisites: Docker Desktop or Docker Engine 20.10+

1) Create a web/.env file (used at build time by Vite):

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_KINDE_CLIENT_ID=your_kinde_client_id
VITE_KINDE_DOMAIN=your_kinde_domain
VITE_KINDE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:9080
VITE_KINDE_LOGOUT_URL=http://localhost:9080
VITE_KINDE_AUDIENCE=your_kinde_audience
```

2) From the repository root, start the stack:

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Web UI: http://localhost:9080
- API: http://localhost:8080
- Database (Postgres): localhost:5432

Migrations run via the database.migration service. You can re-run migrations with:

```
docker compose run --rm database.migration
```

To stop the stack:

```
docker compose down
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 20+, npm
- Go 1.25+
- Docker Desktop (optional, for self-hosting)
- Flutter SDK (optional, for mobile)

Web (React + Vite)
```
cd web
npm install
npm run dev       # start dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build && npm run preview
# Lint
npm run lint
```

Backend (Go)
```
cd backend
# Ensure DATABASE_DSN points to a reachable Postgres instance if running locally
go run ./cmd/api
# Build
go build -o bin/api ./cmd/api
# Test
go test ./...
```

Mobile (Flutter)
```
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run            # run on connected device/emulator
# Builds
flutter build apk      # Android
flutter build ios      # iOS (on macOS)
```

## üîê Backend (Go)
The backend powering SubTracker is written in Go and lives in `backend/`.

- API port: `8080`
- Database: PostgreSQL (`5432`) when using Docker Compose
- Docker images: multi-stage build producing a static binary (see `backend/cmd/api/Dockerfile`)
- Environment variables (via Docker or local env):
  - `DATABASE_DSN=host=database user=postgres password=postgres dbname=app port=5432`
  - `UPDATER_AT_START=true`
  - `DATA_LABEL=/data/labels.json`
  - `DATA_FAMILY=/data/families.json`
  - `DATA_PROVIDER=/data/providers.json`
  - `DATA_SUBSCRIPTION=/data/subscriptions.json`

Run locally (without Docker):
```
cd backend
# Ensure a PostgreSQL instance is available and DATABASE_DSN points to it
go run ./cmd/api
```

Build binary:
```
cd backend
go build -o bin/api ./cmd/api
```

Run tests:
```
cd backend
go test ./...
```

With Docker Compose, the API and database are started from the repo root; see the Self-hosted section above.

## üß© Design System & Styling
- Tailwind CSS utilities for layout/spacing/typography
- shadcn/ui components for accessible, consistent UI
- Radix UI primitives under the hood for a11y

We prioritize Tailwind and shadcn/ui across the app.

## ü§ù Contributing
We welcome issues and PRs! Please follow these guidelines to keep things smooth:

- Write/adjust tests where applicable
- Run checks locally before pushing:
  - Web: `cd web && npm run lint && npm run build`
  - Backend: `cd backend && go test ./...`
  - Mobile (optional): `cd mobile && flutter analyze`
- Commit messages: conventional-ish style is appreciated (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
- Describe your change clearly in the PR and link related issues
